# unco-design-dapp

This project is for recording the Unco in a distributed network.  
Unco, which mean the solid or semisolid remains of the food that could not be digested in the small intestine,are called feces (or poo) in english.  
You can record the status of Unco in a distributed network (IPFS) for free, and you can also tokenize it as an NFT (ERC721).
